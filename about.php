<p class="text">
Hosts Up is a small collection of PHP scripts and HTML documents
I've made to simplify the task of keeping track of live hosts on
my network. It's nothing fancy or anything but it fulfills it purpose.
Hosts Up requires Nmap and that PHP is allowed to run the Nmap program
on the server it's being executed on. It's Nmap that takes care of the
pinging and port scanning of hosts.
