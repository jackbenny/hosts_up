When entering the Hosts Up webpage it scans the network specified in the
index.php file ($network variable) and displays all live hosts. The scan is a
simple ping sweep performed by Nmap. When a host is clicked it is automatically 
port scanned and the results show up on the webpage. That's pretty much all
there is to it.
